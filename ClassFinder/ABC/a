Dear Xiao Hong,       
    class Mr. John Green , our General Manager, will be in Paris from June 2 to 7 and would like to come and see you, say, 
on June 3 at 2.00 p.m. about the opening of a sample room there.Please let us know if the time is convenient for you. 
If not, what time you would suggest. 

Dear Mr. / Ms,       
    Thank you for your class letter informing us of Mr. Green's visit during June 2-7. Unfortunately, Mr. Edwards, our manager, 
is now in Cairo and will not be back until the second half of June. He would, however, be pleased to see Mr. Green any 
time after his return.       
    We look forward to hearing from you.
